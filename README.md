## Using:

- React (for UI)
- React Router (for routing)
- MongoDB (for database)
- Bootstrap 3 (for styling)
- Meteor (for backend)

I chose Meteor in part because setting a backend in node was a pain in the a**
but mostly because it already has Accounts UI and mongo integration and it's so easy
to get started
